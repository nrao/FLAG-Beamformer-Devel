# Derived values

# ROACH and HPC host to be used. The values refer to the sections
# above. Hence, 'cdd_roach=BANKA' means that the roach used would be the
# one indicated by 'katcp_ip' of that section. The various 10Gb/s
# interfaces on the roach would be those used by all the BANKX sections
# above.
#
# Only one HPC player is responsible for setting up and controlling the
# ROACH. The others merely set up their shared memory areas for the HPC
# program, and start and stop the HPC program. The various keywords are:
#
#  cdd_roach: Refers to the BANK section above that identifies the
#  desired ROACH, and any configurations for that roach (for example,
#  the Valon).
#
#  cdd_roach_ips: The above ROACH must be programmed with 10Gb/s IP
#  addresses. These are to be found in the sections listed by this key,
#  in the order given.
#
#  cdd_hpcs: Indicates the HPC hosts that the data should be sent
#  to. Again, it does this by specifying the 'BANK' sections above, in
#  the order given.  For example, BANKE's 'dest_ip' would specify the
#  destination IP to be used.
#
#  cdd_master_hpc: The HPC host whose Player is to control the
#  ROACH. This Player must program the ROACH, issue the arm command,
#  etc, in addition to doing the other things all the Players must do to
#  make this measurement work (shared memory, start the HPC server
#  processes, etc.)
