Datafiles:
1) Each *.npy file contains an array
2) '(c)binN_MxRange_NUMpts.npy': frequency response at Nth bin
       c = This is the center bin in the test
       N = Nth bin in the spectrum
       M = M times of bin width to scan
       NUM = NUM points in the given frequency range to test
3) 'specsN_MxRange.npy': A 2-D array contains spectra in the testing
       N = Nth bin in the spectrum for testing (center)
       M = M times of bin width to scan
4) To use:
       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> binN_resp = np.load('binN_(---).npy')
       >>> plot(binN_resp)
       >>> specsN = np.load('specsN_(---).npy')
       >>> plot(specsN[21])
5) Notes/Questions:
       <1> What happen to the center bin response? For different test cases
contained in this folder, they all look ... strangely messy. Even though the
basic shape are shown.
       <2> To do: add HELP sections to the python code
       <3>
