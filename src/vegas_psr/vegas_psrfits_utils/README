mpimerge_psrfits was modified by Jayanth Chennamangalam for VEGAS
band-stitching.

Dependencies for mpimerge_psrfits:
----------------------------------

psrfits_utils
MPI
CFITSIO

To compile:
-----------

mpimerge_compile

To test MPI:
------------

NOTE: It is assumed that the binaries used are in the path.

You'll need to ssh-add your key before running this, so that you're not
prompted multiple times for your passphrase.

For a simple test to check if MPI is working properly, you may run:
mpirun -np 4 -hosts vegas-hpc1,vegas-hpc1,vegas-hpc2,vegas-hpc3 hostname
This should show the hostnames of the 3 machines that you've specified.

To run:
-------

NOTE: It is assumed that the binaries used are in the path.

Example merge program usage for 6 bands, run from vegas-hpc1/north:
mpirun -np 7 -hosts vegas-hpc1,vegas-hpc1,vegas-hpc2,vegas-hpc3,vegas-hpc4,vegas-hpc5,vegas-hpc6 mpimerge_psrfits -s 1 2012.03.21_233106/psr_vegas_210312_1.00
where the last argument is the combined data directory + base filename of the
data files that need to be merged. The '-np' argument to mpirun is just a count
of the number of hosts you specify following the '-hosts' option. The '-s'
option is to specify which hpcX to start from. For example, if you want to
merge 3 files starting from vegas-hpc3, creating the output on
vegas-hpc1/north, you would run (on vegas-hpc1/north):
mpirun -np 4 -hosts vegas-hpc1,vegas-hpc3,vegas-hpc4,vegas-hpc5 mpimerge_psrfits -s 3 2012.03.21_233106/psr_vegas_210312_1.00

You'll need to ssh-add your key before running this, so that you're not prompted multiple times for your passphrase.
