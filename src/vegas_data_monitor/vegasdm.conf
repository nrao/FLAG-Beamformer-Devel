# Configuration file for Mustang Data Monitor Display.
#
# Currently consists of two section, 'Data', in which one can
# specify the columns and rows that should be monitored, and
# StripChartOptions, which allow the user to set defaults for the
# stripchart.
#
# Columns and rows to be monitored can be specified individually or as
# a range:
#
#   Columns = 1,2,3,4
#   Columns = 1-4
#
# of as a combination
#
#   Rows 0-4,8,10,15-19
#
# Note that there may be spaces between the commas and the numbers,
# but that the range specification must not include spaces: 1-10 is
# ok, 1 - 10 is not.
