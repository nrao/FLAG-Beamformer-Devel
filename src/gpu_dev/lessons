1. Make sure to run all samples in the GPU computing SDK to make sure that
   the card is not bad.
2. Constant memory is faster only if all threads in a threadblock(/warp?)
   access the *same* location, and not if each thread accesses different (even
   contiguous) locations.
3. Texture references have to be global variables.
4. You cannot have an array of texture references.
5. Passing texture references to a function won't work.
6. Using aligned built-in types such as float2 will not work with traditional
   initialisers.
   Example: float2 f2X = {0.0};                 // wrong
            float2 f2X = make_float2(0.0, 0.0); // correct
