Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v13 is vegas mode 13);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc and the decimation rate (e.g. 8r128dr is demux by 8
    with a CIC filter decimation rate of 128)

v13_na_ri_8r128dr_ver101.mdl - this is the first incarnation of mode 13 with only one subband.

v13_na_ri_8r64dr_ver101.mdl - the summer 2012 version with one subband (supports up to 8).

v13_aa_rii_8r128dr_ver102.mdl - moved to roach 2 and uses ASIAA ADC taking every other sample

v13_aa_rii_16r128dr_ver103.mdl - increases number of simultaneous inputs to 16 (decimation
				    rate may be incorrect).

v13_aa_rii_16r128dr_ver104.mdl - adds 8 subbands and fixes decimation rate
