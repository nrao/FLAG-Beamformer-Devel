Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v01 is vegas mode 1);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc, the number of taps in the pfb, and the 
number of pts in the fft (e.g. 8r4t11f is demux by 8, 4 taps, and 2^11 pt fft)

A trailing 'sa' indicates that the design was compiled against the ska-sa/mlib_devel library

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- this is simply a copy of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with 
				the national adc switched out for the asiaa adc

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- functional mode 1 design mostly functional at low clock 
				rates.  Some optimizations for speed have not been made

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- functional mode 1 design, optimized for speeds up to 360MHz

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- This version updates v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl with a 
				conversion from the adc output of fixed 8_0 to signed 8_7 
				for proper input into the pfb_fir.

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver103.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snap blocks for adc 
				and packet headers.  Low clock speeds.. probably no longer 
				useful

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver104.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snaps for adc and a 
				mux of the input to the pfb.  This was added to test the 
				sync pulse

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver105.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 copy of ver4 with register to
				test SSG

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with (hopefully) 
        correct SSG and status bit orders. Should be compatible with system.ucf constraints from 
        ver102 for DSP, thus able to compile at full speed. This design has an error: the spectral
        tick in the SSG block is connected to bit 3 of the counter, so the tick marks every 16 FPGA
        clocks. This will be fixed in ver107
        
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl 
        * corrected spectral tick to 256 FPGA cycles. 
        * moved LEDs to status bits that go into spead header so that it can be
            seen if they are making it to the slaves from the master. 
        * added gpio_oe_n ports as described on the GPIO block documentation wiki page
            without these it seems port b was defaulting to output thus switching signals
            were not making it into slaves.
        * verified 2012.03.20 that slaves are able to read switching signals correctly.
        * associated bof file has some alarming timing errors.
        * KNOWN ISSUE: SSG reset is tied to positive edge of spead_rst which means it gets reset when
            arm is asserted, not when the PPS comes. This should be fixed in v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl
            
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl
        * corrected SSG reset. Now connected to master_rst2.

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver109.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl
        * Added first draft of allowing external blank to be ORed with internal blank.
            This is controlled by bit 6 of ssg_master_slave_sel
            
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver111.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver110.mdl
        * Added ability to choose between ASR input and BLANK input as external blank
            to be ORed with internal blank. This is controlled by bit 7 of ssg_master_slave_sel
            Default of 0 selects ASR input (VEGAS master configuration)
            
v01_na_ri_ssgonly_ver112.mdl -- Based on v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver111.mdl
        * Removed DSP logic for faster builds to improve testing of SSG signals. 
            This line of development will be moved to ROACH II since the GPIO pinouts will be different (and uniform).

v01_aa_rii_8r4t11f_ver113.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver109.mdl
	* Compiles for ROACH2
	* Adds ASIAA ADC (uses every other sample)
	* Removed switching signal generator, removing the GPIOs which were causing compile issues
	    under ROACH2
	
v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver114.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver109.mdl
	* Compiles for ROACH2
	* Adds ASIAA ADC (uses all 16 samples)
	* Design was modified to accomodate 16 simultaneous inputs from each of the ADCs 
	* Removed switching signal generator, removing the GPIOs which were causing compile issues
	    under ROACH2
	
v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver115sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver114.mdl
	* Changed 10 GbE port to use SFP+ card 1 port 0
	* The contemporary edition of casper-astro/mlib_devel is outdated with respect to SFP+, so the design was 
		updated to compile with ska-sa/mlib_devel
    * SSG not present

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver116sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver115sa.mdl
    * Updated adc capture to use snapshot blocks and simplified signal routing
    * raw_adc_trig is new name for original raw_snap_trig in previous designs.
    * In this version, accidentally grabbed top bit of raw_adc_trig to trigger snap blocks, fixed in ver117sa
    * added status and nspec registers for debugging

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver117sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver116sa.mdl
    * fixed raw_adc_trig so LSB triggers ADC capture
    * Added more signals to status register
    * added debug snapshot block to capture status register signals for debugging
