Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v01 is vegas mode 1);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc, the number of taps in the pfb, and the 
number of pts in the fft (e.g. 8r4t11f is demux by 8, 4 taps, and 2^11 pt fft)

A trailing 'sa' indicates that the design was compiled against the ska-sa/mlib_devel library

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- this is simply a copy of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with 
				the national adc switched out for the asiaa adc

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- functional mode 1 design mostly functional at low clock 
				rates.  Some optimizations for speed have not been made

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- functional mode 1 design, optimized for speeds up to 360MHz

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- This version updates v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl with a 
				conversion from the adc output of fixed 8_0 to signed 8_7 
				for proper input into the pfb_fir.

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver103.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snap blocks for adc 
				and packet headers.  Low clock speeds.. probably no longer 
				useful

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver104.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snaps for adc and a 
				mux of the input to the pfb.  This was added to test the 
				sync pulse

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver105.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 copy of ver4 with register to
				test SSG

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with (hopefully) 
        correct SSG and status bit orders. Should be compatible with system.ucf constraints from 
        ver102 for DSP, thus able to compile at full speed. This design has an error: the spectral
        tick in the SSG block is connected to bit 3 of the counter, so the tick marks every 16 FPGA
        clocks. This will be fixed in ver107
        
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl 
        * corrected spectral tick to 256 FPGA cycles. 
        * moved LEDs to status bits that go into spead header so that it can be
            seen if they are making it to the slaves from the master. 
        * added gpio_oe_n ports as described on the GPIO block documentation wiki page
            without these it seems port b was defaulting to output thus switching signals
            were not making it into slaves.
        * verified 2012.03.20 that slaves are able to read switching signals correctly.
        * associated bof file has some alarming timing errors.
        * KNOWN ISSUE: SSG reset is tied to positive edge of spead_rst which means it gets reset when
            arm is asserted, not when the PPS comes. This should be fixed in v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl
            
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver109.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl
        * Added first draft of allowing external blank to be ORed with internal blank.
            This is controlled by bit 6 of ssg_master_slave_sel
            
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver111.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver110.mdl
        * Added ability to choose between ASR input and BLANK input as external blank
            to be ORed with internal blank. This is controlled by bit 7 of ssg_master_slave_sel
            Default of 0 selects ASR input (VEGAS master configuration)
            
v01_na_ri_ssgonly_ver112.mdl -- Based on v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver111.mdl
        * Removed DSP logic for faster builds to improve testing of SSG signals. 
            This line of development will be moved to ROACH II since the GPIO pinouts will be different (and uniform).

	* Changed 10 GbE port to use SFP+ card 1 port 0

    * this design stalled while compiling
    * made debug snap longer and 16 bits wide instead of 32 bit (not sure if that had anything to do with stalled compile)

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver119sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver118sa.mdl
    * same design as v118 but changed back to 32 bit snap. This design compiled.

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver120sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver119sa.mdl
    * this design adds a snap after the stokes block and another after the VACC to debug the problem found in the vector accumulator

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver121sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver120sa.mdl
    * this design stalled while compiling so was renamed to ver122
    * this design is identical to ver120 but the vector accumulator initialization script was updated to fix the problem, so this design should
        not suffer from the vacc bug

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver122sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver121sa.mdl
    * this design is identical to ver121 and is simply a rename because the build stalled during compile.
    * this design is identical to ver120 but the vector accumulator initialization script was updated to fix the problem, so this design should
        not suffer from the vacc bug

v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver124sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver122sa.mdl
    * this design fixes a delay discrepancy in the sync passing by the stokes block
    * found the spectrum to be totall corrupt. Appears to be PFB_FIR or FFT at fault.

v01_md_16r4t11f_ver125sa.mdl -- Updated version of v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver124sa.mdl
    * removed xblocks/pfb_fir_real and replaced with vanilla pfb_fir_real from ska-sa/mlib_devel
    * spectrum still not 100% correct

v01_16r4t11f_ver123.mdl -- Updated version v01_aa_rii_16r4t11f_ver122sa.mdl 
    * addedin switching signal generator
    * renamed to avoid 64 character maximum naming restraint
    
v01_16r4t11f_ver126.mdl -- Update version v01_16r4t11f_ver123.mdl
    * replaced pfb_fir and fft with standard ones from ska-sa/mlib_devel library
    * reduced delay past the stokes block by one intended to resolve an off by 8 
      issue in the spectra

v01_16r4t11f_ver127.mdl -- Rename of v01_16r4t11f_ver126.mdl

v01_16r4t11f_ver129.mdl -- Update version v01_16r4t11f_ver127.mdl
    * add one clock latency to valid signal at output of vacc to try to solve the off by 8 issue.

v01_16r4t11f_ver130.mdl -- Update version v01_16r4t11f_ver129.mdl

v01_16r4t11f_ver131.mdl -- Update version v01_16r4t11f_ver130.mdl
    * added several changes to attempt to improve arm reliability
    * BROKE sync generation in doing so. do not use this design
    
v01_16r4t11f_ver132.mdl -- Update version v01_16r4t11f_ver131.mdl
    * fixed sync generation problem from ver131
    * this design should have fixed vacc and reshaper problems.
    * final output spectra looks ok
    * note snaps triggered on 'valid' signals are off by one.
    * find that vaccout and rshpout snaps are off by two, one is explained by valid. 
        This does not match simulation and does not make sense since final output data
        looks good. Suspect some interpretation/user error.
