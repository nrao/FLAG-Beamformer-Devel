Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v01 is vegas mode 1);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc, the number of taps in the pfb, and the 
number of pts in the fft (e.g. 8r4t11f is demux by 8, 4 taps, and 2^11 pt fft)

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- this is simply a copy of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with 
				the national adc switched out for the asiaa adc

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- functional mode 1 design mostly functional at low clock 
				rates.  Some optimizations for speed have not been made

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- functional mode 1 design, optimized for speeds up to 360MHz

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver103.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snap blocks for adc 
				and packet headers.  Low clock speeds.. probably no longer 
				useful

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver104.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snaps for adc and a 
				mux of the input to the pfb.  This was added to test the 
				sync pulse

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver105.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 copy of ver4 with register to
				test SSG

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with (hopefully) 
        correct SSG and status bit orders. Should be compatible with system.ucf constraints from 
        ver102 for DSP, thus able to compile at full speed. This design has an error: the spectral
        tick in the SSG block is connected to bit 3 of the counter, so the tick marks every 16 FPGA
        clocks. This will be fixed in ver107
        
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver106.mdl 
        * corrected spectral tick to 256 FPGA cycles. 
        * moved LEDs to status bits that go into spead header so that it can be
            seen if they are making it to the slaves from the master. 
        * added gpio_oe_n ports as described on the GPIO block documentation wiki page
            without these it seems port b was defaulting to output thus switching signals
            were not making it into slaves.
        * verified 2012.03.20 that slaves are able to read switching signals correctly.
        * associated bof file has some alarming timing errors.
        * KNOWN ISSUE: SSG reset is tied to positive edge of spead_rst which means it gets reset when
            arm is asserted, not when the PPS comes. This should be fixed in v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl
            
v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver108.mdl -- Updated version of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver107.mdl
        * corrected SSG reset. Now connected to master_rst2.
