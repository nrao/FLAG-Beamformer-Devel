l8 - can be configured to output 1 band or 8 subbands.

### DESIGNS ###
l8_ver121_01.mdl - Test case. ONLY 1 subband. Compiled at 1.5GHz.  
                   Based on ver121, but without black-boxing.
                   Lots of snapblocks.

l8_ver121.mdl - compiled at 1.5GHz clock rate.
                watch out for the labels going into the reshaper.

l8_ver118.mdl - differs from lesser versions in that the order of the SSG 
		status bits (to be sent off to the HPC) have changed to
		3. Blank
		2. SR1
		1. SR0
		0. CAL

### COMPILING ###

l8_verXXX.mdl uses the "Black Boxing" trick to improve the development efficiency. The technique is described in the Casper Memo No.28(http://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/images/a/a4/Black_box_memo.pdf).

Since some of the steps (Extract entity, place pcores in the design, etc) have been done already, so to compile l8_ver100.mdl, there's no need to run through every steps described in the memo.

To compile l8_verXXX.mdl:
0) Enter the directory vegas_devel/newmdls/l8
1) Open cichbcic_core.mdl
2) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
5) Open l8_ver100.mdl
6) Compile it as with other regular mdl files.
