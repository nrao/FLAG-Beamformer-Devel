Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v01 is vegas mode 1);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc, the number of taps in the pfb, and the 
number of pts in the fft (e.g. 8r4t11f is demux by 8, 4 taps, and 2^11 pt fft)

v06_aa_rii_16r4t16f_ver101.mdl -- this is simply a copy of v05_aa_rii_16r415f_ver101.mdl 
				  with the pfb_fir and fft size changed to 16
				  changed vector length in the vector accumulators from 11 to 12
				  changed the output chunk length from 16384 to 32768
